## About Me  
I'm a PhD student at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of the University of Bologna (Italy).
I'm a physicist and I am currently focusing on genomics, metagenomics, and mass spectrometry.  
My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and biomedicine with a particular emphasis on developing models and computational tools for high-dimensional biomedical data analysis.

I enjoy building robust, interpretable, and reproducible pipelines centered on *omics* data and data-driven approaches to clinical and biological problems.

## Main Interests  
- Genomics & Metagenomics – analysis of microbiomes and complex genomic profiles
- Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) – classification task for antimicrobial resistance predictions
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning in Biomedicine – from feature engineering to data integration and predictive models

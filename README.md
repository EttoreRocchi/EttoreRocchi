## About Me  
I am a PhD student at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of the University of Bologna (Italy).
I am a physicist currently studying genomics, metagenomics, and mass spectrometry.  
My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and biomedicine, specifically focusing on the development of models and computational tools for analyzing high-dimensional biomedical data.

I am interested in designing reliable, interpretable and reproducible pipelines in the field of _omics_ data, aimed at providing data driven solutions for biological and clinical problem solving.

## Main Interests  
- Genomics & Metagenomics - analysis of microbiomes and complex genomic profiles
- Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) - classification task for antimicrobial resistance predictions
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning in Biomedicine - from feature engineering to data integration and predictive models

## Featured Projects  
- [EttoreRocchi/combatlearn](https://github.com/EttoreRocchi/combatlearn) - a scikit-learn compatible **ComBat** algorithm for batch-effect correction
- [EttoreRocchi/ResPredAI](https://github.com/EttoreRocchi/ResPredAI) - implementation of the **antimicrobial resistance** prediction pipeline described in the work "Artificial Intelligence model to predict resistances in Gram-negative bloodstream infections" by _Bonazzetti et al._
- [Physics4MedicineLab/CAMISIM-BrokenStick](https://github.com/Physics4MedicineLab/CAMISIM-BrokenStick) - broken stick model implementation for the _de novo_ modality of [CAMISIM](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM)

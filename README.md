## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a PhD student at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna (Italy). I am also part of the Multi-Omics and Health-Care Data Analytics Unit at Sant'Orsola hospital (Bologna, Italy). With a background in Physics, I now work at the intersection of **machine learning** and **biomedicine**, developing **interpretable**, **reproducible**, and **scalable** pipelines for _omics_ data analysis.

### Methodological Focus

<details>
<summary><b>Machine Learning & Deep Learning in Biomedicine</b></summary>
Feature engineering, multi-omics integration, and development of interpretable, generalizable models for clinical and biological prediction tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Algorithms & Models for Biomedical Data</b></summary>
Development of computational algorithms, statistical models, and network-based approaches to simulate, analyze, and interpret biological systems.
</details>

### Application Domains

<details>
<summary><b>Mass Spectrometry</b></summary>
Machine learning methods for predicting antimicrobial resistance from MALDI-TOF mass spectra.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Metagenomics</b></summary>
Advanced biostatistical analysis and network-based modeling of complex microbial communities for microbiome profiling, community simulation, and pathogen detection from environmental and clinical samples.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Genomics</b></summary>
Computational and machine learning approaches for analyzing structural variants and APOBEC-style mutations; computational approaches to CRISPR genome editing.

## About Me  
I'm a PhD student at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of the University of Bologna (Italy).
I am a physicist currently specializing in genomics, metagenomics, and mass spectrometry.  
My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and biomedicine with a particular emphasis on developing models and computational tools for high-dimensional biomedical data analysis.

I am dedicated to developing robust, interpretable, and reproducible pipelines focused on *omics* data, with the aim of addressing clinical and biological challenges through data-driven methodologies.

## Main Interests  
- Genomics & Metagenomics - analysis of microbiomes and complex genomic profiles
- Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) - classification task for antimicrobial resistance predictions
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning in Biomedicine - from feature engineering to data integration and predictive models

## Featured Projects  
- [EttoreRocchi/combatlearn](https://github.com/EttoreRocchi/combatlearn) - a scikit-learn compatible **ComBat** algorithm for batch-effect correction
- [EttoreRocchi/ResPredAI](https://github.com/EttoreRocchi/ResPredAI) - implementation of the **antimicrobial resistance** prediction pipeline described in the work "Artificial Intelligence model to predict resistances in Gram-negative bloodstream infections" by _Bonazzetti et al._
- [Physics4MedicineLab/CAMISIM-BrokenStick](https://github.com/Physics4MedicineLab/CAMISIM-BrokenStick) - broken stick model implementation for the _de novo_ modality of [CAMISIM](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/CAMISIM)
